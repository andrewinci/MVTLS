/**
 *	SSL/TLS Project
 *	\file ServerClientTransportProtocol.h
 *	Basic client/server communication through file. 
 *	It substitutes the transport layer in OSI stack.
 *
 *	PROTOCOL:
 *	The protocol is very simple
 *	8 byte for source
 *	8 byte for receiver
 *	4 byte for packet length
 *	message
 *
 *	Both server and client, after reading a message, blank the file
 *	both server and client cannot write if the file is not blank, they wait
 *
